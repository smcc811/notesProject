## Objective

To create an application where user can create / modify / delete notes

## Tools used:

Understanding of Route functionality ( "GET") and how it retrieves information from
a source and makes that information available to the user. The (" delete ") functionality deletes the selected note when no longer needed . Express was also utilized in this project.

## Enhancements

This project can be enhanced by storing date / time along with note to give user
an indication of how long this note has been stored and the need to delete when needed.
